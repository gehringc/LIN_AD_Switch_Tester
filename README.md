# LIN_AD_Switch_Tester
Windows form application in VB that retrieves switch data via LIN and AD in order to simulate the master function

The majority of the solution I implemented can be found in the Form1 class [Here](https://github.com/gehringc/LIN_AD_Switch_Tester/blob/master/WindowsApplication3/Form1.vb)
